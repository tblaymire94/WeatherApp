Learning Topics

State
=======
State is a plain JavaScript object used to react to user events.
Each class based components has its own state object.
To set state up you use this.state in the constructor.
To update state within the component use this.setState.
Functional components do NOT have state.

Props
=======
A way to pass data from a parent component to a child.
You do this by doing <VideoList videos={this.state.videos} />.
In a functional component you must pass though props as a paramater.

Map
=======
Map will return a new array where each index is the return value of the function.
You use map instead of for loops they are much better to loop.
Each child must have a key prop thats identifiable add this as a prop.

Loading Data From Parent Fast
========
When accessing API data from a parent component it takes time to add to props.
React likes to render the component immediately.
Therefore add an if rule within the component to check if the prop has been setup.
if(!video) {return <div>Loading...</div>;}

Redux
========
Contains the state of the application, what the Data is.
Think about the state before creating the application.

Reducers
=========
A reducer is a function that returns a piece of application state.
All reducers have the state and action as arguments.
They are only ever called when an action occurs.
We initially set the state to be null as this will be when the app first starts.

Container
=========
A container is a React component that has a direct connection with state managed by Redux.
The library 'React-Redux' is the bridge between React(Views) and the Redux(State).
The most parent component of the data should be a container component.
To create a component first add the connect feature.
Then add mapStateToProps function, whatever is returned from this will show up as props inside of the component.
Connect takes a function and a component and produces a container. Now aware of the state in Redux.
If state ever changes the container will be re-rendered.

Actions
=========
Events that a user does or page loads or data received they can optionally call an action creator.
And action creator returns an object that is then sent to all of the reducers in the application.
Reducers can return a different piece of state depending on what the action is.
We always set the action type to be a constant value so that it is always the same throughout the application. Otherwise it will effect all reducers throughout.

Action Creators
===========
Errors that actions must be plain objects means they must return an object with a type & a payload property.
type: 'BOOK_SELECTED',
payload: book

Middleware
=========
Middleware is a function that take an action and depening on the type and payload the middleware can manipluate the action, pass it through or deny it.
Gatekeeper before it gets to the reducer.
You can have many middlewares that can be multiple functions.
Redux Promise is a package that we use that will interpret our promise and just return us the data array that we need. Pretty fricking cool!

Map Dispatch To Props
=========
Anything returned will end up as props within the container.
You can then call this.props.whatever and that will call the action creator

Binding Input Values
========
this.onInputChange = this.onInputChange.bind(this);
The instance of our component has a function called onInputChange we are saying bind it to that
and then replace it with the existing function.
If you are passing a callback remember to bind it to the context.

AJAX Requests In Redux
=========
Get an API key and store it as a string contstant within the actions file.

Ref
=========
Used to setup a reference to a specific HTML element within the application.
So for the Google map we can access it from anywhere via this.refs.map.
We can also render elements within them.

componentDidMount
=========
This is a lifecycle method that is called automatically when the component is rendered on the screen.
